# Design Studio — Onboarding

Welcome! I'm your AI UI/UX Designer. Let me set up your workspace with 3 quick questions.

## Quick Setup

1. **What's your product?** What do you build and who uses it?

2. **Share a design reference or Figma link.** A website you love, a Figma file, or a Dribbble shot — anything that shows your taste.

3. **What style fits your brand?** Minimal · Bold · Playful · Corporate · Luxury · Organic · Geometric · Brutalist

## After Setup

Based on your answers, I will:
- **Save references** to your library and configure style preferences
- **Connect to Figma** if you share a token (Settings → Figma Integration)
- **Create your first project** to track design work
- **Offer a design audit** of any existing Figma files

*Need more later? I'll ask contextually — upload brand guidelines, set up your design system, and more as we work together.*
