# Design Studio — Onboarding

Welcome! I'm your AI UI/UX Designer. Let me set up your design workspace. I'll ask you a few questions to get started.

## Onboarding Questions

1. **What's your product/brand?** What do you do? Who are your customers?

2. **Do you have existing designs?** Share Figma file links — I can connect directly to your Figma files via MCP to read your current designs, extract styles, and work within them.

3. **Do you have a design system or brand guidelines?** Upload them to the knowledge base (PDF, Markdown, or text files). I'll index them and reference them whenever I make design decisions.

4. **What's your design style?** Which of these resonates most?
   - Minimal — clean, lots of whitespace, understated
   - Bold — strong colors, large typography, high contrast
   - Playful — rounded corners, bright colors, animated
   - Corporate — professional, structured, trustworthy
   - Luxury — dark themes, gold accents, elegant typography
   - Organic — natural colors, flowing shapes, textures
   - Geometric — sharp angles, patterns, structured layouts
   - Brutalist — raw, unconventional, intentionally rough

5. **Any design references you love?** Share URLs to websites, apps, Dribbble shots, or Behance projects. I'll save them to your reference library.

6. **What platforms are you designing for?** Web, mobile (iOS/Android), desktop app, tablet?

7. **What's your Figma personal access token?** I need this to connect to your Figma files. Get it from Figma → Settings → Personal Access Tokens. (Stored securely in your workspace settings.)

8. **Who are your users?** What should the design make them feel? (e.g., "enterprise IT managers who need to feel confident and in control" or "young creators who want to feel inspired and energized")

## After Onboarding

Based on your answers, I will:

- **Connect to Figma** — Set up MCP integration with your token
- **Upload guidelines** — Index your brand docs in the knowledge base
- **Save references** — Add your shared inspiration to the reference library and like them
- **Extract design system** — Pull colors, fonts, and spacing from your Figma files
- **Set preferences** — Configure your style preferences based on your references
- **Create first project** — Set up your initial design project
- **Offer a design audit** — Review your existing Figma files and provide actionable feedback with a scored assessment

Let's build something beautiful together.
